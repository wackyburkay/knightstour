Knight's Tour with Enhanced Warnsdorff

This version can be considered as beta, since there is testing and some make-up issues before taking it to demo. By "make-up issues", I mean pinting result as board and some I/O improvements to basic text interface.

Other than that, mostly done. DFS and BFS optimized (as much as I can) and Node Selection finds up to 60x60 as I tested until now.
